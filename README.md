# EasyBook – Smart Appointment Scheduling System

EasyBook is a web-based appointment scheduling application that allows clients to book available appointment time slots with a single service provider. The system automatically generates availability, prevents double-booking, and provides an administrative interface for managing schedules and appointments.

This project was developed as a senior capstone project to demonstrate full-stack web development, backend scheduling logic, and database integration.
